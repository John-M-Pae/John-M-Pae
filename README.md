## Hello There
I am an amateur programer and use this profile to host my various projects. Most of which are smaller scripts.

### Languages
I mostly write software in python, it was the first language I learned and I still find it the most intuitive. I also enjoy the c++ system.
#### Others
As most of my training is in mathematics, I actually do most of my writting in the LaTex markup system. I enjoy playing with formatting and attempting to make
various projects look ~~~good~~~ pleasing and readable.

### Background
I have a masters degree in applied math from RPI and I got my BS in math from the University of Delaware. As a result of this most of my experiance is in the
computational side of design. I am working through projects that try to expand my experiance.
#### Philosophy
I try to learn new skills by overengenering more simple projects. As a result many of the projects I work on are simple at their core, but are built into a more
complicated system. I find that this level of fundamential simplicity makes understanding higher-levels of preformance much more natural.
