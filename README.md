## Hello There
I am a mathematician and amateur programmer. I use this profile to host my various projects, most of which are smaller scripts.
 
### Languages
Most of my programming experience is in Python and Matlab. I enjoy exploring the landscape of developing languages and building up my skill set with new technologies. I work professionally with the .NET framework.
#### Other tech
I do most of my writing in the LaTeX markup system. I enjoy playing with formatting and attempting to make
various projects look ~~good~~ pleasing and readable.
 
### Background
I have a masters degree in applied math from RPI and I got my BS in math from the University of Delaware. As a result of this most of my experience is in the
computational side of design. I am working through projects that try to expand my experience.
#### Philosophy
I try to learn new skills by overengineering more simple projects. As a result, many of the projects I work on are simple at their core but are built into a more
complicated system. I find that this level of fundamental simplicity makes understanding higher-levels of performance much more natural.
